# Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test-in-Python

Custom Python function to calculate the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This repository includes the custom function as well as a reproducible example with dummy data.

- `ks.py` contains the custom function that calculates the KS metric of a model or score that predicts the likelihood of an event
- `ks_example.csv` contains the data needed to replicate the results in `tutorial.ipynb`, which teaches the user how to use the `ks(·)` function
